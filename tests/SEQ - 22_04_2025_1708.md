**Note 1:** In this sequence (after 200 Generations), dinos are tested just agains the cactus. This test shows a strong negative weight associated to obstacle_x which is the the x offset of the cactus obstacle in the dinos' 3D world and a strong positive weight associated with the dinos' height.

**Note 2:** After a bunch of tweaks on game physics and other complex feature polymorphing functions (to make sure the environment is perfect and some what natural), the dinos started to show real significant learning and cross-generational evolution. Birds have also been introduced into the obstacle generation function but they were really a pain to master. dinos seemed to always jump over them until I randomized their flight heighs.
